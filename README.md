## What are data structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. It defines the relationships between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.

- Interface (ADT) (Abstract Data Type)
  > It's a contract
  > Think on a list
  > you can search; you can get a value; you can set a value...

## How we can measure?

```javascript
const printEven = () => {
  for ( let i = 2; i <= 100; i++ ) {
    if ( i % 2 === 0 ) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
```

- Count on a time?

```javascript
console.time('evens')
printEven()
console.time('evens')
```

- Count based on instructions?

```
1. let i = 0
2. i <= 100
3. i++
4. if
5. i % 2 === 0
6. console.log
```

- And if we change the instructions?

```javascript
const printEven = () => {
  for ( let i = 2; i <= 100; i += 2 ) {
    if ( i % 2 === 0 ) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
```

We have a better implementation. We have the same instructions, but less steps due to `i += 2`
